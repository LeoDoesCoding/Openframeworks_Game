# Openframeworks_Game
2021/22 course project.
The API connector requires a key. It is provided within the document, but I have not tested this since its creation.

## Project overview
Using OpenFrameworks for the UI, this is a game which connects to weatherapi's weather data to retrive and use relevant data to influence the game.

The plant requires addiquate water and sunlight levels to grow. To do this, a location must be entered. Deppending on the forecast for this location (and future forecast, deppending on the day at current play) the water and sunlight stats will change accordingly.
The plant dies if either bar is depleted.
